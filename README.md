OCScriptingBridgeExcelController
================================

OCScriptingBridgeExcelController is a class that manages the interaction between applications via Scripting Bridge, specifically Excel.

This provides an example of Scripting Bridge code outside of Apple's ecosystem. Apple makes their apps fairly Scripting Bridge-saavy, whereas there
can be limitations when it comes to working with non-Apple apps.

One of the chief benefits of this class is that it obviates much of the ceremony required by Scripting Bridge.
